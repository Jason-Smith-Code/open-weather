## Description

Open weather app is an application I built to learn about working with api.
It's been a fun little project and certainly helped my understanding of some things I was struggling with including:
- useEffect
- Ternary Operators
- Redux Toolkit

I suspect that my code could be vastly improved, and would absolutely love some feedback and areas to improve :)

## Objective

My aim was to work with open weather api, allow a user to perform a search and return the data relevant to that search.
I built this with a user in mind, who just wants a fast real time reading of the current weather in a given location.
The user will also be able to change the unit type displayed in either metric or imperial.

This app will be built with react, redux and be rendered in the users browser.

## Project status

I would love to have the background image of the application change based on both the time of day and the current weather.
At this stage I have not implemented any testing
